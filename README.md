# ai_asteroids
A fun experiment to apply concepts of perception, behavior generation, trajectory planning, and motion control to the classic arcade game Asteroids.

This project uses as a base the simple python implementation of Asteroids from Amin Bandali (https://github.com/aminb/asteroids), which was cloned on Feb 10, 2019 and used under the GLPv3 license.
